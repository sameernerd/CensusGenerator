Every time we make a lot of effort in conducting the 'Census' but still so much effort goes in vain.
The technology we are using is ICR which reads hand written data and digitalizes it.It is a good technique and it gives a blasting accuracy of 95%.
But why not to do something even more better and get an accuracy of 100%.Think for a second,where are we lacking ? We have digitialized our daily life on social sites
and still conducting census on papers.Major part of delay in analyzing census data is because of duplicacy in data.
Suppose we just use app for taking data,this will help in reducing the time.But what about the redundancy..?
For removing the duplicates we thought of using fingerprint that will help us in not having two or more fields of same person.
To achieve this we will have one centralized database and several decentralized database in states which will store data of state people.
Now because of having such a database maybe one person tries to get evaluated two times so the app will check if the person's fingerprint
is present in database or not.If present it will show enumerators freedom to fill all the missing details but will not able to directly
manipulate the previous data.So by this approach we will get rid of duplicate datas.
One other advantage of having such an exhaustive database in any country that we will be able to relate how people migrated from one state to another,will be able
to find links easily in most of criminal cases.Suppose a child/person is missing then we will be able to check states database and he/she will able to return home easily.
So as you can think,digitalizing the census in above stated ways can help us in achieving so many additional good things.
